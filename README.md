# TwentyTwentyTwenty
This is just a simple app to prevent me from having to set alarms on my phone or something else. Its only use is to provide an on screen alert with a tone to remind
me to observe the Twenty Twenty Twenty rule when it comes to eye health. Every twenty minutes look away twenty feet for twenty seconds.

## Installation

- **OSX** - You will need to allow the executable file permissions to run. This can be done with `chmod +x ./OSX-Twenty`
